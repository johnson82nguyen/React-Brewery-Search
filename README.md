# Final Project

This is my final project. This application allows users to search for breweries using the Openbrewerydb api. This application runs on a javascript library called React.js which allows for a fully responsive application.
## Installation

To run this project, make sure you have the correct [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your device. Once you have node installed on your device you can either download the zip from Github or you can clone it to your device. To clone it to your device by HTTPS, run
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

which in this case is 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnson82nguyen/modus.git
```

## Usage
Once you have the final downloaded or cloned, navigate into the home directory in your terminal/command line. You'll know you're in the home directory if you see the src and public directories

``
ls
```

If you see src or public directories you're good to go


```python
cd modus-main 

or

cd modus
```

After making it to the home/main directory run

```
npm install
```
This will download all the dependencies needed in order to make this project run. To start the project run the command below once the dependecies are downloaded
```
npm start
```

## react-scripts not found?

If you're running into this issue running the code, run the following command

```
npm install --save react-tinder-card --legacy-peer-deps
```
